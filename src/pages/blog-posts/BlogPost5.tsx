              <p>As industrial robots become increasingly common in manufacturing environments, ensuring safe human-robot interaction has emerged as a critical challenge. The traditional approach of complete separation between robots and human workers is giving way to collaborative environments where humans and robots work together. This shift brings both new safety challenges and innovative solutions.</p>
              
              <h2>The Evolution of Industrial Robotics</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>Physical barriers and safety cages separated robots from humans</li>
                <li>Emergency stop buttons as the primary safety mechanism</li>
                <li>Complete shutdown required for human intervention</li>
                <li>No ability to detect human presence or adjust operations</li>
