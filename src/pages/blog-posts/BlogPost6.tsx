              <p>Voice interaction has emerged as a transformative interface in customer service, complementing text-based chatbots with more natural and accessible communication. As speech recognition technology and natural language understanding continue to advance, voice bots are evolving from basic IVR systems to sophisticated conversational agents that enhance customer experience across multiple channels.</p>
              
              <h2>The Evolution of Voice Interfaces in Customer Service</h2>
              
              <h3>First Generation: Touch-Tone IVR</h3>
              <p>Early voice-based customer service relied on basic menu systems:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Numeric menu selection through telephone keypads</li>
                <li>Limited branching logic for simple routing</li>
                <li>Pre-recorded messages with minimal personalization</li>
                <li>Frustrating experiences with deep menu hierarchies</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Second Generation: Speech Recognition IVR</h3>
