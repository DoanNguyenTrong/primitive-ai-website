              <p>Legal document automation is revolutionizing how legal departments and law firms operate, reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks, minimizing errors, and allowing legal professionals to focus on higher-value work. This transformation is being driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning technologies.</p>
              
              <h2>The Evolution of Legal Documentation</h2>
              
              <p>The legal profession has traditionally been document-intensive, with lawyers spending countless hours drafting, reviewing, and managing various legal documents. This traditional approach has several limitations:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Time-consuming manual drafting processes</li>
                <li>Inconsistency across similar documents</li>
                <li>Risk of human error in complex documents</li>
