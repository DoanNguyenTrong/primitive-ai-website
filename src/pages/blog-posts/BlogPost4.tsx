              <p>Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been the backbone of document digitization for decades. However, modern Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solutions are now moving far beyond basic character recognition to deliver more accurate, context-aware, and automated document processing capabilities.</p>
              
              <h2>The Evolution of Document Processing Technology</h2>
              
              <h3>First Generation: Basic OCR</h3>
              <p>Traditional OCR technology focused primarily on converting scanned documents into machine-readable text:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Character-by-character recognition using pattern matching</li>
                <li>Limited ability to maintain document formatting</li>
                <li>Minimal contextual understanding</li>
                <li>High error rates with poor-quality documents</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Second Generation: Template-Based Extraction</h3>
              <p>The next evolution introduced template-based approaches:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Pre-defined templates for common document types</li>
                <li>Extraction of specific data points based on position</li>
                <li>Basic validation rules for extracted data</li>
                <li>Still heavily dependent on consistent document formatting</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Current Generation: AI-Powered IDP</h3>
              <p>Today's IDP solutions leverage multiple AI technologies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Computer vision for document classification and layout analysis</li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing for contextual understanding</li>
                <li>Machine learning for continuous improvement</li>
                <li>Template-free processing capabilities</li>
                <li>Multi-modal understanding (text, tables, images, handwriting)</li>
              </ul>
